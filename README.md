# Our Finetuned Universe

An interactive exploration of the improbable conditions that allow complexity to emerge in our cosmos. Discover how the fundamental parameters of reality appear precisely calibrated for the existence of stars, planets, and life itself.

## üåå About

This interactive web application takes you on a journey through the cosmic fine-tuning that makes our universe not just possible, but inevitable in its complexity. From the initial entropy of the Big Bang to the formation of matter, from stellar nucleosynthesis to planetary habitability‚Äîexplore the delicate balance of forces that govern our reality.

## ‚ú® Features

### Interactive Sections
- **The Beginning**: Explore initial entropy, expansion rate, and density fluctuations
- **Formation of Matter**: Understand quark binding, mass hierarchy, matter vs antimatter, and proton stability  
- **Starlight & Heavy Elements**: Witness stellar nucleosynthesis and element creation
- **The Galactic Heart**: Discover black holes and galaxy evolution
- **Planets & Habitability**: Find the Goldilocks zones for life
- **Abiogenesis Lab**: Simulate the emergence of life from chemistry

This application presents cosmic fine-tuning as:
- **Observable phenomena** with measurable parameters
- **Open scientific questions** rather than settled conclusions  
- **Interactive exploration** encouraging curiosity and discovery
- **Accessible explanations** connecting complex physics to everyday experience
